Ogaiago can import .osr scores and replays in your ripple database, or simply remove the header of an .osr file to get a server-like replay. It's up to you.  

Make sure you have **Python 3** installed.  
Make a folder called `replays` in the same directory as `ogaiago.py` and place your `.osr` files exported from osu! in that folder.  
*Optional:* If you want to import the scores inside a ripple db and rename the server scores atomatically, rename `config.sample.ini` to `config.ini` and configure it with your ripple db credentials.  
Then, run
```
$ python3 ogaiago.py
```
and magic will happend.
For more options and arguments, run
```
$ python3 ogaiago.py --help
```
That's it! You're well on your way to become an ogaiago na emoceb ot yaw ruoy no llew er'uoY !ti s'tahT
